# Implementation

This requires clear modeling in case of strict implementtion wanted to be the goal reached. No deviations are allowed to be extortion or LAN - WiFi neglected. It's just a matter of infrastructure - laptop & smartphone - so called target market approach.

C2C is distanced namespace, because individual developer isn't working to nearby malls (shopping) nor to their eCommerce development. It's a nearby agenda similarity to a gates series (C ...) which can be used against the developer in case of dispute and legal ethics. So, enterprise scale it's, nevertheless, alluring, though may be intimidating due to the fact of stated called agents impunity, which means enterprise - PHP dev agency - i. e. pbgroupeu.wordpress.com - risk exposure, stating the same in several cases - Maxima nearby base development and opportunity (opportunistic behavior) of the target market approach, neglecting and altogether affirming the Maxima rights and infringing them nevertheless.

Therefore it's recommended to dissolve the essence of this to the target folder, pbgroupeu namespaced PSR4 format. It will contain the models and controllers, which are declared in *mission & vision* page, exactly *mission* settlement - section.

## Appendix

Base of this way of derivatives is a casual - forced, exaclty, by market conditions - low amount of cash flow - reserveless - walk home by the Maxima, observing gates series and therefore, conjuncting ECTS Economics case, transposing them image type to an internal namespace, which is, in that, case, presumably factually concerned ethical, though it's not stemming initial commit stage, then evolving (like, e. g. C2C non competition agreement etc.), it's besides that - rather motion motivated. It's secure to state this opportunity risk managed, rather than apply ECTS image transposition directly, meaning that the latter is always the opponing force of critical acclaim enabled. This current approach is developer beneficial, meaning that case of ECTS - localhost development - is exactly project scale - git, RCS - SCM regulated, repository enabled (cloud, likely, or internal enterprise host) & JIRA - Trello supervised, leaving no space of doubt where it or something from source code belongs.

These vague belongings, like a distance range development, leaked only by a source code power consumption modulations (demodulated in advance by power supply companies infrastructure - initially, i. e. beforehand) - is constituting a major threat of misinterpretations; it's assumed it's legally binding, but a simple look into it is dissiparing any concern related to it. It's primarily a focus oriented, meaning that a RAM - SSD loaded *modeling* is referred to *modulations* by default, which isn't a case neither *theoretically* nor *practically measured* (econometrics application).

Therefore a distinct goals setting is a developer matter, enterprise facility and premises concern. It's legally binding, enabling opportunistically stated **C2C** to a case of malware free adherence to a blogging site delcared retention policy - mission & vision statements. Corporate statements of a formulated development is only income and an aforementioned capital assets - laptop & smartphone oriented. Nothing else. Capitalization & classificatin of shopping malls - centres - is a-sophistically settled, it's a nominal demand, impressions left behind and expressive ORM models formed. So, when it's stated it's an individual enterprise - clients are missing; it's nothing else, except a fact. It's not an impunity case, it's a goal oriented modeling in order to earn money. Customer of this entity is not present, it's offloaded of work, because of the **insufficient market demand** of this type of work - i. e. development w/o/ internet, ordered or not from ISP like *Telia* or *C-gates*. Due to this, a lack of understanding - of namely, basics of economics, especially of enterprise economics - is causing a direct losses to the geotags placed Maxima base in a local mall form; ATM and snacks targeted exclusively, it's an impunity case of to be so called local infringements - **JIRA** & **Trello** repositories (*git*) aimed distance by a non-related non even 3rd party actors (economic). The latter scale is dangerous, as risk exposed (because of). Therefore, in order to diminish its dangerous level of openess to losses, it's an explicit declaration (goals implementation) of risk impunity aversion - PBG namespaced methodology, encompassing necessary prerequisites for the MVC design patterned arthitecture of C2C short term loans business.

## Target models

* Account
* Loan
* Currency
* Transaction (log)

Initial scope is, luckily, relevant enough to state a concerning status. It's implemented (to be) easily, without a fuss and directed by a management concern, so called **ECTS ethics** (managmenet course). Requrements for this subject (so called matter) are ambivalent, but can be distinguished into several coutnerpart, emphasizing critical speed, non-lazyness and atomic TDD - FDD units, extinguished into:

* Model
* API controllers

sets of atomics.

## ETL atomics

Called via API port DNS. *TDD drills* is then abolished, meaning stated API consumption is php server enabled (cronjob); endpoint is reached and ETL is executed HTTP routes callback mode. TDD is only - and mainly, enterprise practice - *FDD* concerned:

* Loan

## Loan rates

Enterprise facility retains the interest rates consuming demand to the case of formulated adjacency - customer (issuing) C2C loan is interest rated. These are expressed in percentage form and a fixed part of it is set to the pbgroupeu.wordpress.com. In the begining it can be ~10 % of the rate, i. e. this slice is paid off back **not to the issuing customer**m but to the hosting enterprise - so called *profit share*, or, if you want (in a strict form - terms) - *commission fee*.
